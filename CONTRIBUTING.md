# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. We only accept contributions via pull requests on [Github](https://github.com/tpg/larave-image-renderer).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard.](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- **Test!** Nothing will be accepted if there are no tests.
- **Document.** Make sure you update any documentation. The `README.md` and any other relevant documentation should be kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle.** We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
- **Create branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

For any major features or request, please open an issue first to discuss your ideas.
